Forks and pull requests
repo is sitting on Github in my account. 

Repo duplicate instance. 
Fork a repository / taking an entire other instance of the repo and putting exact replica of it into another account. 

If I decide to do stuff I can make branches and stuff, without affection the original core version. 
it is upp to owner of original repo to take decision on pull changes. That is why it is pull request.



In forked version I commit some changes. I can commit directly to master in forked repo OR I can create branch instead.
