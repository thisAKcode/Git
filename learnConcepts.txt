ADD SOMETHING TO REMOVE LATER.
Let's start with some basic term:
1. repository
2. clone
3.push or pull
4. pull request. Merge. Open a pull request. 
# Saying will you please take those changes from created branch and merge them into master.
# comments here and there
5. master, branches, ...
# the moments of each commit has uuid. If I'm not sure that I want to edit my master branch.
6. commit (like save but having his own unique identifier - hash)
7. the line for some concept I don't remember.

git remote -v

git add .
git commit -m 'describe shortly'    
git push origin master
